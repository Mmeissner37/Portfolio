          I come from a medically heavy background. From working with clients as
          a Customer Service Representative to working with animals as a
          Licensed Veterinary Technician, my work experience up to this point
          has consisted entirely of veterinary clinics. I went to Radford
          University and graduated, with cum laude with honors, with a Bachelors
          of Science. I worked the front desk of a local veterinary clinic
          before enrolling in an AVMA accredited school to obtain my license as
          a veterinary technician. Five years later, I started a program to
          become one of the few Veterinary Technician Specialists in Dentistry
          (VTS(Dentistry)). There are just over 100 of us in the world! I have
          been published in professional journals, spoken at veterinary
          conferences, and achieved several certifications.

          <br></br>I started my software journey mid-2022 utilizing mostly
          self-taught methods. YouTube videos, W3 Schools and good old-fashioned
          books. I was hooked from my first print(“Hello World”) in PyCharm.
          freeCodeCamp tutorials offered a great start to responsive web
          design, but I wanted a more in-depth approach. So, I enrolled
          with devCodeCamp and started their Software Development Flex Bootcamp.
          The 22-week bootcamp offered a guideline on what to learn while
          requiring the ability to self-study, trouble-shoot and problem-solve on my own. Most
          nights and weekends were spent working on projects and researching
          hurdles. The process was intense. Learning to code full-time while
          working full-time was a challenge I took on and don’t regret.
        </ul>

          My certificate of completion was a milestone I am so proud of. I look
          forward to strengthening my skills, developing new ones, and gaining
          experience in the years to come.
