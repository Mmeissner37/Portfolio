          I come from a medically heavy background. From working with clients as
          a Customer Service Representative to working with animals as a
          Licensed Veterinary Technician, my work experience up to this point
          has consisted entirely of veterinary clinics. I went to Radford
          University and graduated, with cum laude with honors, with a Bachelors
          of Science. I worked the front desk of a local veterinary clinic
          before enrolling in an AVMA accredited school to obtain my license as
          a veterinary technician. Five years later, I started a program to
          become one of the few Veterinary Technician Specialists in Dentistry
          (VTS(Dentistry)). There are just over 100 of us in the world! I have
          been published in professional journals, spoken at veterinary
          conferences, and achieved several certifications.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          Anyone who knows me has asked the same question when I talk about changing careers:
