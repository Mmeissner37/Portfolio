                <ul>I come from a medically heavy background. From working with clients as a Customer Service Representative to working with animals </ul> 
                <ul>as a Licensed Veterinary Technician, my work experience up to this point has consisted entirely of veterinary clinics. I went to </ul>
                <ul>Radford University and graduated, with cum laude with honors, with a Bachelors of Science. I worked the front desk of a local veterinary </ul> 
                <ul>clinic before enrolling in an AVMA accredited school to obtain my license as a veterinary technician. Five years later, I started a </ul>
                <ul>program to become one of the few Veterinary Technician Specialists in Dentistry (VTS(Dentistry)). There are just over 100 of us in the </ul> 
                <ul>world! I have been published in professional journals, spoken at veterinary conferences, and achieved several certifications.</ul>

                <ul>Software is all around us. In TV applications, to our phones, to the paperless systems in veterinary hospital, and to the dental program my current clinic uses. Iâ€™ve seen and worked with many. </ul>
